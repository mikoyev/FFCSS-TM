# FFCSS-TM

Simple Firefox CSS theme manager for the lazy folk that don't want to dig through AppData every time they want to change their CSS theme. 
FF's Proton made me do this. 100% guaranteed tasty spaghetti code.

Features:

- Integrated access to the FirefoxCSS Store (https://firefoxcss-store.github.io/) with download manager;
- Downloaded theme zips will be automatically either put in your selected Themes folder or, if not present, in a created "Themes" folder created in the same directory as the .py file, and added to the list seamlessly;
- Current theme, Profile path and Theme paths are saved on a local .db file.

To do:

- Add folder windows executable;
- Add single file windows executable;
- Version control for downloaded themes;
- ~~Figure out cross-platform with linux;~~ **DONE**
- ~~Add interface with CSS Theme Store directly inside the app.~~ **DONE**


Side note:

This is a personal side project born out of out laziness and boredom. I'm not a programmer so I tend to use every problem I have to learn new code and tools, so expect very quirky solutions here and there.
