# FFCSS-TM

Simple Firefox CSS theme manager for the lazy folk that don't want to dig through AppData everytime they want to change their CSS theme. 
FF's Proton made me do this. 100% guaranteed tasty spaghetti code.

To do:

- Add folder windows executable
- Add single file windows executable
- Figure out crossplatform with linux


Side notes:

This is a personal side project born out of out laziness and boredom. I'm not a programmer so I tend to use every problem I have to learn new code and tools, so expect very quirky solutions here and there.
