# FFCSS-TM

Simple Firefox CSS theme manager for the lazy folk that don't want to dig through AppData everytime they want to change their CSS theme.
FF's Proton made me do this. 100% guaranteed tasty spaghetti code.

To do:

- Add folder windows executable
- Add single file windows executable
- Figure out crossplatform with linux
